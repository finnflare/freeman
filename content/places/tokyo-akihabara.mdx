Spent the afternoon exploring retro game stores and tiny parts shops off the main strip. Found a vintage Game Boy Color in pristine condition and collected a handful of obscure transistors from a dusty component vendor. The district's energy is electricâ€”neon signs, towering electronics stores, and endless treasure hunts through basement arcades.
