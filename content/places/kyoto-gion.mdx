I wandered Gion around sunset and learned about the district's teahouse culture. The narrow streets came alive with soft lantern light, and I caught glimpses of geiko hurrying to their appointments. The wooden machiya houses felt like stepping back in time, each one preserving centuries of Kyoto's refined aesthetic.
